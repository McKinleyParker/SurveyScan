How do you test APIs like this?
How do you connect a machine learning function structure in the backend? Just import it as a function in one of the django apps?
CRUD application includes Delete, is there any best practices for backing up something as you delete it?
API should return primary keys for property object?

How do you update projects that are already deployed? What is this process called?

Is there a good primer to get started on understanding what is DevOps?


How can I easily map what type of objects my endpoints need?
Why do all my get requests go through each time I send a post request?
Why do my API's get called twice? (and how can I stop this for put requests)

Why is it so important to have the onChange update function be for the form not for individual fields?

Why are my states always logged as one state behind?
