How do you test APIs like this?
How do you connect a machine learning function structure in the backend? Just import it as a function in one of the django apps?
CRUD application includes Delete, is there any best practices for backing up something as you delete it?
API should return primary keys for property object?

How do you update projects that are already deployed? What is this process called?

Is there a good primer to get started on understanding what is DevOps?
